# poe_trade_client

## What is this?
An example pathofexile.com/trade client written with Python.

It demonstrates how to search, livesearch and whisper using the api.

## How to use?
```
git clone https://github.com/ChanceToZoinks/poe_trade_client
cd poe_trade_client
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 ./app.py
```

This will perform a search for Redbeak on standard and output the first 10 results to a file called redbeak_search.json, then it whispers me (by default) for an Incandescent Heart I have listed on standard and finally sets up a live search for Tabula Rasa.
